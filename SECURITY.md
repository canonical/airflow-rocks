# Security Policy — Airflow Rock (OCI Image)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The easiest way to report a security issue is through a [GitHub Private Security Report](https://github.com/canonical/airflow-rocks/security/advisories/new) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

Alternatively, to report a security issue via email, please email [security@ubuntu.com](mailto:security@ubuntu.com) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.

## Supported Versions

The Airflow rock follows the Apache Airflow release cadence, built on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. The product currently ships interim releases; no LTS commitment is made at this time.

| Rock Version | Apache Airflow | Ubuntu Base              | Status          | End of Standard Support |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| 3.1.x        | 3.1.x          | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble) | **Pre-release** | TBD                     |

Older rock versions receive no further security updates. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a supported version.

## Product Lifetime and Support Phases

| Phase                    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Support**     | Active bug fixes, security patches, and new image builds.         |
| **Security Maintenance** | Security patches only; no new features or non-critical bug fixes. |
| **End of Life (EOL)**    | No further updates. Users must upgrade to a supported version.    |

Support periods are defined in the Workflows team support policy. The current `3.1` series is in **Pre-release** and will transition to Standard Support upon first stable release, followed by Security Maintenance prior to its End of Standard Support date.

## Vulnerability Response

Security vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to the following severity thresholds, based on NVD CVSS scoring:

| Severity     | CVSS Score | Initial Response | Target Remediation |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **Critical** | 9.0 – 10.0 | Within 24 hours  | Within 7 days      |
| **High**     | 7.0 – 8.9  | Within 72 hours  | Within 30 days     |
| **Medium**   | 4.0 – 6.9  | Within 2 weeks   | Within 90 days     |
| **Low**      | 0.1 – 3.9  | Best effort      | Best effort        |

All **Critical** and **High** severity vulnerabilities will be remediated or have an active remediation plan in place. Any vulnerability listed in the [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) is treated as highest priority regardless of CVSS score.

Vulnerabilities in this rock are continuously monitored via [oci-factory](https://github.com/canonical/oci-factory)'s automated scanning. Vulnerability findings and build announcements are tracked via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/canonical/airflow-rocks/security/advisories) and coordinated internally with Canonical's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).

Note that this rock packages the upstream [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow). Vulnerabilities in the upstream Apache Airflow project itself should be reported to the [Apache Security Team](https://www.apache.org/security/) directly; Canonical will track and apply upstream fixes to supported rock versions.
